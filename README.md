# jsQR engine to embedQR

The library at hand has been adapted to serve as engine to embedQR by reference to the interface of processing an image url in return for the string representation of its contents. It is a fork of [danimoh/jsQR](https://github.com/danimoh/jsQR), which in turn originates from the [cozmo/jsQR](https://github.com/cozmo/jsQR) port of the [zxing/zxing](https://github.com/zxing/zxing) library. Besides the interface compaction, concurrency as well as image preprocessing in terms of downscaling and rotation as necessary have been integrated to advance recognition. The result is ready to use under dist/jsQR.js and requires ECMAScript 2017 or newer.
